# AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for ETL Job on `meta_Kindle_Store.jsonl.7z`

This repository contains an **AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** solution that uses **boto3** to automate the setup of AWS resources and perform an **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** job on the `meta_Kindle_Store.jsonl.7z` dataset. 

The ETL job processes the nested JSON structure, flattens it, and converts it into a **Parquet format** for further data analysis.
